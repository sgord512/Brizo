This is my work-in-progress implementation in Haskell of R5RS. 

I'll fill this in over time with specifics regarding what I have successfully implemented and what is yet to come. For the time, being, I've basically ipmplemented only addition, define, and the various type predicates.

Also, what does the name 'Brizo' mean?

Brizo was a Greek goddess, protector of sailors, and others who used the seas. She was responsible for the dreams that sailors would have that would tell them about future conditions, or otherwise provide them prophecies.
